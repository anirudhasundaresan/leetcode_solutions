283. Move Zeroes

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Note:

You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.

Answer: Two-pointer approach; logic

class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        # identify where the first zero occurs and use two-pointer method from there
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i]==0:
                break
            i += 1

        j = i + 1
        while j < len(nums):
            if nums[j] != 0:
                nums[j], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[j]
                i += 1
            j += 1

        #return nums
