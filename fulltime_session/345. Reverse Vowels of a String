class Solution:
    def reverseVowels(self, s):
        # two-pointer approach here - this approach usually works for problems with reversing and removal
        # string is immutable
        s_ = list(s)
        vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
        i = 0
        j = len(s_) - 1
        while i < j:
            if s_[i] not in vowels:
                i += 1
            if s_[j] not in vowels:
                j -= 1
            if s_[i] in vowels and s_[j] in vowels:
                s_[i], s_[j] = s_[j], s_[i]
                i += 1
                j -= 1

        return ''.join(s_)
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
