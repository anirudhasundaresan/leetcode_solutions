53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Answer: Array, DP

''' Much simpler approach; :/ whyh did I not think of this!?
# Idea is to keep changing the nums array accordingly
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i-1] > 0:
            nums[i] += nums[i-1]
    return max(nums)
