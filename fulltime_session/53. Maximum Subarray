53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Answer: Array, DP, Kadane's algorithm (using max subarray at previous index and current index)

''' Much simpler approach; :/ why did I not think of this!?
# Idea is to keep changing the nums array accordingly
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i-1] > 0:
            nums[i] += nums[i-1]

Kadane's algorithm:

If you want the start and end slice indices, too, you need to track a few more bits of information (note this is still O(1) space and O(n) time, it's just a bit hairier):

def mssl(l):
    best = cur = 0
    curi = starti = besti = 0
    for ind, i in enumerate(l):
        if cur+i > 0:
            cur += i
        else: # reset start position
            cur, curi = 0, ind+1

        if cur > best:
            starti, besti, best = curi, ind+1, cur
    return starti, besti, best
