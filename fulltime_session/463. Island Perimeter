'''
463. Island Perimeter

You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

Example:

Input:
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Output: 16

Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:

Answer: HashMaps? - Think logic, don't always go for direct implementation

class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid):
        # they are certain that there is only 1 island
        # and it is not connected diagonally
        perim = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    ctr = 0
                    for k, l in zip([i-1, i+1, i, i], [j, j, j-1, j+1]):
                        if k in range(0, len(grid)) and l in range(0, len(grid[0])):
                            ctr += grid[k][l]
                    perim += (4 - ctr)
        return perim

Better solution - more logical -
Since there are no lakes, every pair of neighbour cells with different values is part of the perimeter (more precisely, the edge between them is). So just count the differing pairs, both horizontally and vertically (for the latter I simply transpose the grid).

def islandPerimeter(self, grid):
    return sum(sum(map(operator.ne, [0] + row, row + [0])) # see the use of map, operator.ne
               for row in grid + map(list, zip(*grid)))
