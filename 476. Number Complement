## Problem Statement ##
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

## My Python3 code ##
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num):
        stra = bin(num)[2:]
        new_s = []
        for i in range(len(stra)):
            new_s.append(str(1-int(stra[i])))
        return int((''.join(new_s)),2)
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        
#### Best solution: return num ^ (2**(len(bin(num))-2)-1) ####
