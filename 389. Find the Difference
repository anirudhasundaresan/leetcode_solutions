## Problem Statement ##
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Find the letter that was added in t.
Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

## My Python3 code ## [Best: return list(collections.Counter(t) - collections.Counter(s))[0]]

class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        for i in s:
            t = t.replace(i,'',1) ## only first occurences..at a time
        return t
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
